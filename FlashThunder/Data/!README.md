# Entities
> Entities require just a component dictionary
> The key of each chunk of component data will have its first letter capitalized and "Component" added
to the end. For example, "health" -> "HealthComponent".
> This translated name must match with an existing component class name.

# Textures
> Textures require a textureAlias and a textureName. 
> TextureName is used to get the texture from the content manager.
> TextureAlias is what the game uses to find the texture.
> For example, alias "tile_fumo" is used by the game to get texture "fumo.png" from the content manager.
